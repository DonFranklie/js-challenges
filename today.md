## Today's Challenge: Reverse a String
Write a JavaScript function that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed.

For example:

```javascript
reverseString("Hello, World!");
```
Output:
```javascript
"!dlroW ,olleH"
```
## Challenge 2 {Put on Hold}:
Write a function called **capitalizeWords** that takes a sentence as input and returns the sentence with the first letter of each word capitalized.

### Requirements:

Ensure that only the first letter of each word is capitalized, and the rest are lowercase.
Assume that words are separated by single spaces and handle mixed-case inputs.
Example:

```javascript
Copy code
console.log(capitalizeWords("hello world")); // "Hello World"
console.log(capitalizeWords("javaScript is fun")); // "Javascript Is Fun"
console.log(capitalizeWords("HELLO from the OTHER SIDE")); // "Hello From The Other Side"
```
Hint: Try using **split**, **map**, and **join** to make it concise.
